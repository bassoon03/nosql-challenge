Creation of repository
This file contains the setup and analysis starter code for the NoSQL Challenge. I believe I used both Geeks for Geeks and W3 Schools as reference sources. Often times a give query will be repeated because multiple things need to be done with same query and if the query is not given immediately before certain tasks, the result is often meaningless gibberish or an empty data frame.
